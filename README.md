Task1 to visualize histogram on age distribution and bar plot on gender distribution

TASK 01 Completed: Visualizing Data from a CSV using Python!

As part of my Data Science journey, I completed Task 01 â€” creating visualizations using a real dataset stored in CSV format. This task helped me explore the basics of data loading, cleaning, and visual representation.

Objective:
    To visualize the distribution of variables like Age (continuous) and Gender (categorical) using plots like histograms and bar charts.**

Steps I Followed:


 1.Collected the Dataset:
 
       I sourced a real-world dataset from Kaggle, which contained demographic details like Name, Age, and Gender.
    
 2. Loaded the CSV File:
    
       Using Python, I imported the CSV file into a DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

 4. Explored the Data:
    
       I reviewed the structure of the dataset by displaying the first few rows and checked for missing or inconsistent values.

 6. Cleaned the Data:
    
       To ensure accurate visualization, I removed rows with missing data in critical columns such as Age and Gender.

 8. Created a Histogram:
    
       For the Age column (a continuous variable), I created a histogram to observe how the population was distributed across different age ranges.

 10. Created a Bar Chart:
     
       For the Gender column (a categorical variable), I plotted a bar chart to compare the number of individuals in each gender category.

 12. Interpreted the Results:
     
       These visualizations provided insights into the gender ratio and the dominant age ranges within the dataset.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas â€“ for data loading, cleaning, and exploration

Matplotlib â€“ for creating the histogram

Seaborn â€“ for creating the bar chart with a polished look
